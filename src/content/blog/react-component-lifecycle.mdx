# React Lifecycle in 4 Minutes

Mastering the React lifecycle is the first step to debugging like a pro.

Here's an easy **4-minute guide**.

## What Is the React Component Lifecycle?

A React component is like a human being. Born, evolve, and die. React components follow a lifecycle: they're **born** (*mounting*), they **update**, and then they **die** (*unmounting*).

* **Mounting**: React creates the component and adds it to the DOM.
* **Updating**: The component changes in response to state changes.
* **Unmounting**: React removes the component and cleans up resources.

## Why Do You Need To Understand React Component Lifecycle?

Understanding the React lifecycle helps you write better effects with `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`, avoid inefficiencies, prevent memory leaks, and optimize performance.

## The Three Phases of the React Component Lifecycle

### 1. Mounting: When a Component Is First Rendered

Mounting occurs when React adds a component to the screen. Triggered by `root.render(<MyComponent />)` or when React adds a component to the JSX tree.

**Mounting process:** Render, Insert DOM Nodes, Set DOM Refs, Run `useLayoutEffect`, DOM Paint, Run `useEffect`.

### 2. Updating: When a Component Re-Renders

Updating happens when React re-renders a component to reflect changes. Triggered by state updates, context changes, parent re-rendering, etc.

**Updating process:** Re-render, Reconciliation, Commit Changes, Unset DOM Refs, Cleanup `useLayoutEffect`, Set DOM Refs, Run `useLayoutEffect`, Paint the DOM, Cleanup `useEffect`, Run `useEffect`.

### 3. Unmounting: When React Removes a Component

Unmounting occurs when React removes a component from the DOM. Triggered when a component is no longer in the JSX tree, parent unmounts, or the component's key changes.

**Unmounting process:** Run Cleanup Functions, Unset DOM Refs, Remove DOM Nodes.

## Summary

Three phases: mounting, updating, and unmounting. unmounting.

Start practicing these concepts with real-world examples:

- Use useLayoutEffect for DOM measurements.
- Always clean up effects when a component unmounts.

You've got this ðŸ’ª.
