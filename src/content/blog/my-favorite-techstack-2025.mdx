## Introduction

As a frontend engineer, I'm always exploring new tools and technologies to build better, faster, and more maintainable web applications. While the landscape is constantly shifting, I've found a combination of technologies that I believe will be a powerful and enjoyable stack to work with in 2025.
This post outlines my favorite frontend tech stack for the coming year, explaining the rationale behind each choice.

**React**: The unopinionated architecture of React is a key reason it remains my primary choice for frontend development. This flexibility, combined with a vibrant ecosystem of supporting libraries and frameworks, empowers developers to build highly customized applications efficiently. For instance, when building user-interaction-focused websites where SEO is less critical, I frequently leverage the speed of Vite as a build tool alongside React to provide a highly responsive development environment. The combination of React's component model with Vite's performance makes for a powerful development workflow.

**Next.js**: is a framework that builds on top of React. It is one of the most popular choices when building full-stack applications with React, because it comes with lots of features out of the box (e.g. routing, caching, image optimization, etc), several rendering strategies within the same application to optimize for different goals and all the recent features from React (e.g. Server Components and Server Functions) to connect your React application to the backend, providing a seamless experience for building modern web applications.
